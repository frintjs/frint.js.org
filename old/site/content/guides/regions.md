## What is a Region?

By now, we have discussed how:

* Root Apps are created
* Creating and registering Apps
* Rendering Root Apps

But we didn't talk about rendering the Child Apps yet.

We do that via `Region` component, that is shipped with `frint-react` package.


## Illustration

We will see some code examples below.

## Register Apps with region name

When registering apps, you can pass extra information like the Region where you want it to be mounted on to:

```js
window.app = new App(); // root app

window.app.registerApp(App, {
  regions: [
    'sidebar'
  ]
});
```

We just registered an App in our Root App, and provided enough information to let it know that we want our App to be mounted in a region somewhere which happens to have a name `sidebar`.

But the `sidebar` Region does not exist yet. Let's define it next.

## Defining a Region

Since `Region` is a component itself, we can implement it in the root component of our Root App:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Region } from 'frint-react';

class RootComponentOfRootApp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <section>
          <p>Hello world</p>
        </section>

        <aside>
          <Region name="sidebar" />
        </aside>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

All we did from our Root App is just to define a Region, and give it a name `sidebar`.

Now whenever an App becomes available, and it happens to have a target region of the same name, it would get rendered within that specific Region.
