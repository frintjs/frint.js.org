## What is an App?

Everything in Frint is wrapped inside an App. They contain all the bits and pieces in the form of [providers](../providers).

An App can be of two types:

* **Root App**: The root app.
* **Child App**: Apps that get registered to the root app.

We will see some code examples below.

## How to create an App?

An App can be created using the `frint` package:

```js
import { createApp } from 'frint';

const App = createApp({
  name: 'MyAppName'
});
```

Now you can instantiate it:

```js
const app = new App();
const name = app.getName();
console.log(name); // `MyAppName`
```

## Root Apps

In any page at any given moment, there can be only one Root App. This is the top-most parent App, where other Apps can register themselves to.

Let's create one:

```js
import { createApp } from 'frint';

const RootApp = createApp({
  name: 'MyRootApp'
});
```

Now it can be instantiated:

```js
window.app = new RootApp();
```

## Child Apps

Child Apps are apps that get registered to the Root App.

Child Apps can be created in the same way as Root Apps are created:

```js
import { createApp } from 'frint';

const App = createApp({
  name: 'MyApp'
});
```

Now unlike Root Apps, child Apps are not instantiated manually. They are registered to Root Apps instead:

```js
window.app.registerApp(App);
```

To access your App instance:

```js
window.app.getAppOnceAvailable$('MyApp')
  .subscribe(function (app) {
    const name = app.getName();
    console.log(name); // `MyApp`
  });
```

We use observables, because an App may get registered at any time. Either at initial page load, or at a time in future asynchronously. They may even come from a separate bundle altogether.
